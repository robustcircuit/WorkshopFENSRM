# Web technologies for cognitive science - preparation

None of the following suggestions are mandatory but they could help you to get more of the workshop and help us to identify possible incompatibility issues with your laptop beforehand, so as to debug you or to bring a substitution laptop.

It will also saves you some time once at the workshop (time that could be well used at the pool or at the beach!).

## Software to install

| Software  | Version |  Comment | Use in the workshop | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Git | [Any](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  | Use installer defaults | Version control tool that facilitates one's life :) |
| Nodejs | [18.15.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)  | Use installer defaults | Create of a local webserver on your machine and connect with AI APIs |
| MongoDB | [6.0.5](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)  | After installation add mongod.ex to your system path ([Win](https://dangphongvanthanh.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/add-mongos-bin-folder-to-the-path-environment-variable/), Mac/Linux: if you don't manage we'll set it up at the workshop)| Create of a local database on your machine |
| Unity | [2020.3](https://unity.com/download)  | Download Unity Hub. Once in the app, go to Installs, Install editor and select the 2020 version | Create multiplatform games on your computer |
| VisualCode (optional) | [Any](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  | Use install defaults | VSCode is probably the best code editor at the moment. If you don't have it already, it might be worth to install it! Otherwise, if you are already fluent with another editor, feel free to stick to it! |
| Anaconda (optional) | [Any](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads)  | Use install defaults (feel free to untick register as default python) | Anaconda is quite useful to manage Python environments, but if you are already familiar with Python environments, feel free to use your own approach |
| Inkscape (optional) | [1.2.2](https://inkscape.org/)  | Use install defaults | Inkscape is very useful when it comes to designing cross-platform web experiments and SVG files will be used in some practical sessions |

In general, jsPsych has pretty good documentation. You can have a look at their [tutorials](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/video-tutorials/) and browse a bit their website to have a sense of how powerful this framework is. No need to engage with coding in jsPsych before the workshop!
